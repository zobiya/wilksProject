# wilksProject
A calculator that collects the data of a powerlifter then produces a score that represents their relative strength.

This project is written in PHP and JavaScript.

The site produces a form that asks a user for their weight, biological gender, the weight of three main lifts (deadlift, squat, benchpress) and then calculates a number using that data. After calculating a Wilks score, the application then asks the user if they want to submit their score into the database. Upon submission, the site will redirect the user to the Scores page that lists all submitted scores from users.
